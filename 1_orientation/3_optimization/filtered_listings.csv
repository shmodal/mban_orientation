Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions. 

For others, I am more than happy to host you! Let's keep this community happy

Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions. 

For others, I am more than happy to host you! Let's keep this community happy

Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions. 

For others, I am more than happy to host you! Let's keep this community happy

I'm originally from Atlanta but have been living Boston in the famous the North End of Boston for the last 15 years.  Last summer I had the pleasure of AirBnB'ing in St. Petersburg Florida and I'm looking forward to continuing that here in Boston.  I owned and operated a hostel in downtown Boston for six years and I'm a big fan of hostels, so the spaces I rent are often shared.
.  
I love traveling, meeting travelers and helping them out with finding affordable accommodation where ever I am.  I'm opening another hostel soon and thought this would be a great way to continue what I like to do in the meantime.
