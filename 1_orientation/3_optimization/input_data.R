## Script parameters
# We start by setting values for the variables that we need to choose to determine the output of the script. These values go at the top of the script so that they are easy to find and change. If we want to turn this script into a function, these parameters would be our input arguments.

# These parameters indicate the criteria we will use to filter the listings
min_score <- 90
min_reviews <- 5
allowed_neighbourhoods <- c("Downtown","Back Bay","Chinatown","West End", "Beacon Hill", "Allston-Brighton")

# These parameters describe the dates and length of stay for which we want to check availibility.
nights <- 3
#args = commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE)
#dates = ymd(args[[1]])
#print(dates)
# If you want to run this script in RStudio, set the dates manually
